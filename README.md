# VEXIQ_iOS_ROBOTC
This is based off the awesome demo by James Pearman showing how RobotC can talk to a the VEX IQ brain using the new Smart Radio. 

iOS side is written in Swift
Vex side is written with RobotC

Allows you to turn on and off a motor in port 8.
Allows you to change the colour of a Touch LED in port 2

If the Touch LED is touched, it tells the app.

More cleanup to come.

#Notes:
Make sure you have the VEX IQ Smart Radio firmware installed
Make sure you have the RobotC Smart Radio fireware installed
Exchanging Data did not work while I was debugging in RobotC, so VEX IQ brain needs to not be connected to PC? Very odd.
